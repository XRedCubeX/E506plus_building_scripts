# A building script for start a build (includes exports,mkdir KERNEL_OBJ, brunch)

I decided to do this script because I happened to have some errors like "no rule to make target / KERNEL_OBJ / obj" and therefore to fix, for each build you need to recreate the folder and do all the commands and therefore i made a script that just start the script and start building with all the fixes.
